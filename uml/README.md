UML Diagram (project_diagram.puml)

How to render:

1) Install Graphviz (dot) and ensure `dot` is on PATH.
2) Download `plantuml.jar` from https://plantuml.com/download and place it in the repo root (or set environment variable `PLANTUML_JAR` to the jar path).
3) Use the helper script from project root:
   - `tools\render-uml.bat`

Or use the VS Code PlantUML extension (requires Graphviz): open `project_diagram.puml` and press Alt+D to preview.

If rendering fails, open the PlantUML output or run the batch script and paste any error message here — I can fix syntax or help resolve environment issues.
